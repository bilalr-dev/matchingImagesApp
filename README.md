# Image Matching App

A simple Flutter app that challenges users to match images by randomly changing them and providing feedback on success or failure.

## Overview

The "Match the images" app is designed to entertain users by presenting two images and encouraging them to match the images by tapping on the corresponding buttons. The images change randomly on every tap, providing a dynamic and engaging experience.

## Features

- **Random Image Changes:** The app generates random images on each button tap, keeping the challenge fresh and unpredictable.

- **Feedback Messages:** Users receive immediate feedback on their matching attempt. If the left and right images match, the app displays a "Matching" message; otherwise, it encourages users to try again.

- **Colorful UI:** The app features a vibrant and visually appealing user interface with an indigo background.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the App:** Open the app to view the main screen, which consists of two images and matching buttons.

2. **Match the Images:** Tap either of the buttons to change the images and attempt to match them.

3. **Receive Feedback:** Look for the feedback message at the top of the screen. If the images match, it will display "Matching"; otherwise, it will suggest trying again.

4. **Retry:** Tap the buttons again to get new random images and continue the matching challenge.

## Development

The app is built with Flutter, a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
